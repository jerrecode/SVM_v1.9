We define a Riemannian metric over the thermodynamic layer state space $\Omega_n := \{S_n, \pi_n, T_n, Q_n\}$ using curvature of the free energy $F(S_n)$:

\begin{equation*}
g_{ab} = \partial_a \partial_b F(S_n)
\end{equation*}

In terms of statistical physics, this corresponds to:

\begin{equation*}
g_{ab} = -\partial_a \partial_b \log Z
\end{equation*}

The metric captures fluctuations and geodesic paths in the thermodynamic manifold. The curvature $R$ of this manifold may be interpreted as encoding gravitational analogues in the SVM framework.
